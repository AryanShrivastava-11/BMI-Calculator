App supports both orientation: Lanscape and Portrait. This app is supported on all the iPhones and iPads running on iOS 13+. The design pattern which is followed here is MVC Design Pattern. 

The app has two ViewControllers. There is a segue between them which is presented modally. The background of the final ViewController changes according to the BMI Value. 
Red colour means Overweight, Yellow is Underweight whereas Green depicts Normal/Fit.
